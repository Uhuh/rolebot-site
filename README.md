# What is this?
I'm _trying_ to work on a dashboard site for my Discord bot [Rolebot](https://github.com/Uhuh/rolebot).  
I want to make it easier for users to learn how to use commands, and obviously make a "portal" for users to advertise it with.

The plan for now is to get the bare basics of a site where we just show off some pictures with commands, show commands list and basic invite stuff. Eventually I want to allow users to be able to manage all their react roles on the site.
